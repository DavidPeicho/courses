This project is a implements a very small and silly GoOgle search.
It basically creates an unordered map fitting in the RAM.

The project has only been tested with Python 3.0, we recommand you
to use the same version has we did.

In order to run the program, you can execute the following:
$ python3 main.py -i assets/emails/rec.autos -s 'lama !OR we' -idx test/test.idx

----------
Arguments:
----------
All the arguments are are optional, in order to let you choose
what you want to do. You can:

-> --input/-i path_to_folder: Gives the path to the folder containing
the data on which the index is built

-> --save-index/--si: Specifies the location to save the build index file.
Important: if this argument is not given, the index is not saved on the disk.

-> --index/-idx: Specifies the index file use for search.
Important: If you do not provided a precomputed index, the process
will try to build an index from the input folder given with (-i).
If there is no input folder, it will fail and exit.

-> -s QUERY: Searches a given query.
A query should be define under the form: "toto !OR lama !AND kikou".
The process will then create an AST from left to right.
So, with our simple example:

                   !OR
                  /   \
                toto !AND
                     /  \
                   lama kikou

You can use : !AND, !OR, and !NOT.
Be careful, !NOT is a unary operator and should be placed
before what you want to negate.

There is also something else to note, if the word does not exist at all, the query
will be default abort. So, "!NOT akdakdkda" will give no results if "akdakdkda"
is not in the index.

---------
Examples:
---------
- Create an index from the folder `assets` and save it to `lama_des_bois.index`, without
running any query on it:
$ python3 main.py --save-index lama_des_bois.index -i assets

- Create an index, do not save it and run a query on it:
$ python3 main.py -i assets/emails/rec.autos -s "check"

- Use an index saved on the disk, and run a query on it:
$ python3 main.py -s '!NOT adsorption !OR lama' --index test/test.idx

* Returned value

```
{
  "_index": "test",
  "_type": "tweet",
  "_id":"1",
  "_version":2,
  "result":"updated",
  "_shards":{
    "total":2,
    "successful":1,
    "failed":0
  },
  "_seq_no":1,
  "_primary_term":1
}

Here, we can see that the `result` key has value `updated` instead of `created`.
The `_seq_no` value is also increased, but this is quite obvious.
